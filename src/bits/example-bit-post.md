This is an example **bit** - a short-form post designed for quick how-to guides, tips, and things I learned today.

## What Makes Bits Different?

Unlike blog posts, bits are:

- **Shorter** - typically under 500 words
- **More focused** - one concept or tip per bit
- **No categories** - only tags for organization
- **No thumbnails** - keeping it simple and text-focused
- **Quick to read** - scannable with headers and code examples

## When to Use a Bit

Use bits for:

- Command-line tips and tricks
- Quick code snippets
- Configuration examples
- TIL (Today I Learned) moments
- Short tutorials

## Example Code Block

Here's how code looks in a bit:

```bash
# Example: Create a new Git branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

## Finding Bits

You can browse bits by:

- [Year](/archive/#by-year) - chronological archive
- [Tag](/archive/#by-tag) - topical organization
- [Type](/archive/#by-type) - see all bits at once

That's it! Keep bits concise, practical, and helpful.
